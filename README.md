## Contribute guidelines
- This repository represents the whole project, not a container for partially solutions. Your implementations should be included in `Java Resources/src`.
- Please do not create unnecessary packages, if there is an existing package which you could use - **USE IT!**
- Take code reviews, submitted code should be reusable, easy to understand and well documented.
- Try your best to produce "clean" code
- Always attach a description to your pull-request, so me or @MICSTI know what's the aim of your pull-request without the need to take a deep look inside your code or commit messages.
